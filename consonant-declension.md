When there is no case ending added to the stem, the stem may lose its final
consonant, because in ancient Greek it is a phonetic law that words must end
either in a vowel or in -ν, -ρ, or -ς.

*Accentuation*: as for other nouns, the accent is persistent. But there is a special rule
for all monosyllabic-stem nouns of the consonant declension. Monosyllabic stems
(e.g., κλωπ-, above) have the ultima accented in the genitive and dative of all num-
bers, with acute on short U, circumflex on long U (e.g., κλωπί, κλωπῶν). In the other
cases the accent falls on the first or only syllable.


## Labial and Velar Plosive Stems

Nouns of this type, all masculine or feminine, have stems ending in π, β, or φ (labial plosives) or in κ, γ, or χ (velar plosives). 

- The acc. sing. has -ᾰ.

## Dental Plosive Stems

Nouns in this group have stems ending in τ, δ, or θ, the
dental plosives.

### Masculine and feminine nouns.

Dental plosives of this group are for the most part
nouns with the nom. sing. in -ις. Fewer nouns have the nom. sing. in -ας or -υς.

- Nouns in -ις were in origin i-stems without a dental plosive, and this accounts
for the existence of two stems. The shorter stem survives in the nom. and voc.
sing., the dat. pl., and sometimes the acc. sing.; the longer stem, clear from
the gen. sing., appears in the other cases.
- The acc. sing. has a noteworthy variation in disyllabic stems ending in ιτ, ιδ,
or ιθ:
  - If the second syllable of the stem is accented, the longer stem (with dental
consonant) is used, and the acc. sing. ending is -ᾰ (e.g., ἀσπίς → ἀσπίδα).
  - If the first syllable of the stem is accented, the shorter form of the stem
(without dental consonant) is used, and the acc. sing. ending is -ν (e.g.,
χάρις → χάριν).

### Masculine nouns with stem in ντ

The full form of the stem is visible, as usual, in
the genitive singular, and the nominative and vocative singular and dative plural are
again the cases that show variation.

- In nouns like γέρων, the nom. sing. has no ending added (and tau has been
dropped for phonetic reasons) but shows a strong-vowel form of the stem (ω
for ο in γέρων). The voc. sing. also has lost its tau but retains the weak vowel ο
in γέρον.
- In nouns like γίγας and ὀδούς, the nom. sing. has sigma added, and the
combination of consonants -ντς is simplified to -ς, but the preceding vowel is lengthened in compensation
(ο becomes ου in ὀδούς; ᾰ becomes ᾱ in γίγας).
- The same ντσ sequence is also simplified in the dative plural, with the same
compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel.

### Neuter nouns with stem in τ

The full form of the stem is clear in the genitive
singular, and the nominative, accusative, and vocative sing. and the dative plural
show variation. 

- In nouns like πρᾶγμα, no ending is added in the nom., acc., voc. singular, and
the final tau is dropped.
- In other nouns an alternative stem is used for the nom., acc., and voc. sing. (τέρας, ὕδωρ, φῶς)
- The nom., acc., and voc. pl. form has short alpha (-ᾰ), like all neuter forms.
- In the dat. pl. the tau does not appear, by analogy with dental stems of the first
type.

## Consonant Stems Ending in a Liquid (λ, ρ) or Nasal (ν)

Almost all nouns in this group are masculine or feminine.

- The nom. and voc. sing. have no case ending, but the nom. has a strong-vowel
form of the stem: e.g., ω for ο in ῥήτωρ and δαίμων. An exception is ἅλς, the
only noun in λ, which adds -ς in the nom.
- Acc. sing. has -ᾰ.
- Stems with final ν do not exhibit it in the dat. pl., but there is no compensatory
lengthening.

## Irregular Stems in ρ

Three important words for family relationships have variable
stems ending in ρ: πατήρ ( father), μήτηρ (mother), and θυγάτηρ (daughter).

- a strong-vowel form in -τηρ (nom. sing. only)
- a normal grade with short vowel, -τερ- (several cases)
- a weak grade realized as -τρ- in the gen. and dat. sing. or as -τρᾰ- in the dat. pl.

The common noun ἀνήρ is similar, but the Attic forms have δ inserted before ρ in all
cases except the nominative and vocative singular.

- The voc. sing. of all four nouns has recessive accentuation.
- The nom. sing. of μήτηρ and θυγάτηρ also has recessive accentuation.
- The trisyllabic forms of πατήρ and μήτηρ are accented on the second syllable
(the stem ending -ερ-, or -ρα- in the dat. pl.).
- The rule about monosyllabic stems (Unit 14.2) applies normally to the gen. and
dat. sing. of μήτηρ and πατήρ, and θυγάτηρ is treated similarly by analogy.
- The same rule applies to the forms of ἀνήρ that have a one-syllable stem,
whereas the disyllabic stem in the nom. sing. and dat. pl. is accented on the second syllable of the stem. (The voc. sing., as already noted, has recessive
accentuation.)

## Stems in Sigma

Most nouns of this type fall into two classes: masculine proper
names in -ης, -ους, and neuter nouns in -ος, -ους. Both kinds originally had stems
ending in -εσ-, but in most forms the sigma has dropped out between vowels, and
the remaining ε has contracted with the vowel of the case ending; in the dative plural
double sigma has become single. 

- In the masc. nouns the nom. sing. -ης is a strong-vowel form of -εσ-.
- The pure stem is seen in the voc. sing. of masc. nouns, and this form is accented
recessively on A.
- The acc. pl. of the nouns in -ης is assimilated to the nom. pl. and not based on
the usual ending -ᾰς.
- The -ος in the nom., acc., and voc. sing. of the neuter nouns is an o-grade variant
of -εσ-.

A few sigma-stem neuters have final -ασ- (e.g., γέρας): again, whenever the sigma
drops out, contraction takes place. In the paradigms, the uncontracted forms (some-
times found in poetry and in other dialects) are shown in parentheses after the Attic
prose forms.

## Exceptions

The non-Attic form of φῶς is φάος. Ιn Attic the
contracted stem is treated like a monosyllabic stem (φωτός, φωτί, φωσί) except in
the genitive plural, which is accented φώτων.
